üìç Location Permission (Used Only When Necessary)

Purpose: The App may temporarily access coarse location information (e.g., Wi-Fi scan results) solely to determine whether nearby Wi-Fi devices are compatible with the App.
Important Note: Location data is processed locally on your device only. It is not uploaded, stored, or used for any other purpose.

üì∑ Camera Permission

Data Deletion: If you have taken photos or videos through the App and wish to delete them ‚Äî whether intentionally or by accident ‚Äî you can easily remove them using the App's built-in media management feature or directly through your device's photo gallery or file manager.
